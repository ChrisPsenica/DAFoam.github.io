We will organize an online DAFoam workshop on June 9, 2021, from 9 am to 12 pm EST.

The objective of this workshop is to get you familiar with how to run optimizations with DAFoam. To be more specific, we will go over the OpenFOAM and DAFoam configuration files (e.g., controlDict, fvSchemes, runScript.py) and have a hands-on section that allows you to run OpenFOAM and DAFoam cases. 

If you are interested, please register from [here](https://forms.gle/zc92G9kpQAVGpd6f8). Here we also have a few optional survey questions that can help us better prepare the workshop materials. Once finished, we will send you the workshop Zoom link. The detailed schedule will be posted one week before the workshop. 

We are looking forward to seeing you.
