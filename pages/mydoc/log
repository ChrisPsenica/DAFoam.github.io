mydoc_get_started_post_processing.md:Once optimization is done, first check "opt_IPOPT.txt" in tutorials-master/NACA0012_Airfoil/incompressible. "opt_IPOPT.txt" contains the variation of functions with respect to the optimization iteration:
mydoc_get_started_post_processing.md:Next, we can use [Paraview](https://www.paraview.org) to visualize the flow fields. Download the Paraview binaries [from here](https://www.paraview.org/download). They are ready to use for Windows, Linux, and MacOS. Once installed, open the Paraview app and click "File->Open..." from the top menu. In the pop-up window, navigate to tutorials-master/NACA0012_Airfoil/incompressible, select the paraview.foam file, and click "OK".
mydoc_get_started_run.md:To run this case, first download [tutorials](https://github.com/DAFoam/tutorials/archive/master.tar.gz) and untar/extract it. Since we use the pre-compiled DAFoam Docker image, we need to first start the Docker container (a light-weight virtual machine). If you use **Linux**, use the commands on [this page](mydoc_get_started_start_docker_linux.html). If you use **MacOS**, use the commands on [this page](mydoc_get_started_start_docker_mac.html). If you use **Windows**, use the commands on [this page](mydoc_get_started_start_docker_windows.html).
mydoc_get_started_run.md:The above command will start a docker container, mount the **current directory** on your local OS (tutorials-master/NACA0012_Airfoil/incompressible) to the container's **mount** directory, login to the container's mount directory as dafoamuser, and set the relevant DAFoam environmental variables. You may see something like this on your terminal: `dafoamuser@00fb6ceac4da:~/mount$`. 
mydoc_get_started_runscript.md:As mentioned in [Overview](index.html), DAFoam uses OpenFOAM for multiphysics analysis. So before running DAFoam optimizations, one needs to set up an OpenFOAM run case for NACA0012 airfoil. tutorials-master/NACA0012_Airfoil/incompressible has the following folder structure:
